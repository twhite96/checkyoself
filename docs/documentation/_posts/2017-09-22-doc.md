## Installation

No installation needed. Just fork the repo, install dev dependencies, and get running.

## Usage example

Coming soon. WIP.

## Development setup

There are a few dependencies and I want to thank [@btford](https://github.com/btford) and the [@NaturalNode](https://github.com/NaturalNode) Organization for their awesome tools which without them this wouldn't be as easy.

Fork the repo, and add your own `package.json` file with:

```bash
npm init
```
and fill in all the gritty details.

The site uses Brian Ford's `write-good` linter for native English and NaturalNode's `natural` for the tokenizers in its Node npm module.

To install `write-good`:

```bash
npm install write-good
```
...and natural:

```bash
npm install natural
```

Usage examples are coming. Too many ideas. Plenty of feature creep. 👎🏽😩
