## What is Check Yo Self

Check Yo Self is a little web app you can use to check the grammar and spelling of your markdown blog posts or any other markdown text.

## What Stack are You Using?

Currently using [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the UI, [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) as a styling framework, and [SimpleMDE](https://simplemde.com/) for the markdown editor.

## Are You Storing My Words Anywhere?

I am using a [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database/) to sync and store your data so that you can come back to your work at any time and pick up right where you left off.

## Are You Going to Sell My Data?

No. Not in the slightest. I detest this kind of thing and **would never sell your data**: it would diminish your trust in me and my other projects and would be against the motto *use your code for good*.
