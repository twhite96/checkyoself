Version 1.0 of Check Yo Self is almost ready for release. It should be soon, no ETA. But I am working with a couple people in order to understand how I should use a certain component within the context of the app: Should a change the functional component to a class based one in order to pass down state the `Text.js` component? I am not sure, however, and that is the hold-up.

## Long Time Long Wait

I know. It's been about a year and I still haven't gotten this relatively straightforward app built. But I should be releasing it here soon.

Here are a couple of photos of the UI:
