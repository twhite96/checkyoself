It has been quite a while.

I planned to have v1 ready all the way back in September. Unfortunately, things have been a bit busy here of late, and when collaborating with a friend of mine, my hectic schedule and his health issues meant that I couldn't really get what I wanted done, done.

Part of the reason is that I was trying to shoehorn features into the `Text.js` component that just wouldn't work.

I found a snippet of a `writeGood` component at [lyleg/write-good-web](https://github.com/lyleg/write-good-web/blob/master/src/suggestion.js). This would work perfectly *if* I was using `Draft.js` and I really wasn't willing to rewrite the whole `Text.js` component.

## Facebook and Draft.js

I was scrolling my Facebook newsfeed and there was a notice that Facebook Open Source changed their URL. *Fine*, I thought and opened up the link. I scrolled some of the open source projects they have listed and Draft.js was one of them. Curious, I decided to check it out. The editor example was *perfect*. I set out to find a markdown version and I found [Mulesoft's md-draft-js, a Markdown text editor for React](https://github.com/mulesoft/md-draft-js). This is even better.

I am looking at both the docs for `md-draft-js` and `Draft.js`, trying to get familiar with the `Draft.js` API and concepts.

I plan on looking for something on YouTube to get me started and then diving into the docs some more this weekend.

Unfortunately, because this is more involved than `SimpleMDE`, it will be at least another month or two before Check Yo Self is finished. I am still in the process of getting ready to interview and interviewing so I have to think about how much time I want to dedicate to this. I also know that finishing this is really important.

I have my work cut out for me these next couple of months.
